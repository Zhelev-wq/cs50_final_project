The idea here is to create a program that takes a docx or other kind of text file and parses it for SEO keywords
How it works:
    -takes docx, odt, or other file format
    -requires input for a user-defined number of keywords
    -the program separates the text file into paragraphs or lines or sentences
    -then it parses the segment for keywords matches, with each match recorded in a dictionary
    -the dictionary will have the keywords a keys and the number of matches as values

Implementation (one main() and 3 supplemental functions required):
    -docx module can be used to work on docx file
    -other formats will have a different approach
    -there are probably similar modules for txt, odt, etc.
    -consider implementing a function that recognizes text file formats
    -there are several options that you can use to create the match function
    -regural expressions
    -a floating point window in a for loop
    -FlashText module (not sure how this thing works yet, supposed to be more efficient than regex)
    -the supplementary functions need be able to be tested with pytest(which is some bullshit you have no idea on how to implement yet)

The parsing algorithm will certainly pick up on 1 to 1 matches with the input keywords
Consider what to do about partial matches, which contain parts of a keyword or where progper grammar makes direct implemntation of the keyword impossible (best casinos UK > best casinos in the UK)

Potential functions:
-keyword input:
    asks user for the number of keywords
    then they are entered on by one
    alteratively you pass a txt file with each keyword on a new line
    the keywords are then added to a dictionary with the keyword being the key and the number of matches being the value (starts at 0 (zero))
    consider how to implement keywords, as entire strings of broken down into individual list elements
    
-parsing algorithm:
    method for parsing direct matches (easy)
    method for parsing partial mathces (kinda fucked up)
        for your needs specifically a list of counteries will work
        you can create a regex of some kind where the algorithm will allow a certai number of words before the country strings

Keywords in test document:
online casinos that accept paysafecard 
best online casinos paysafecard 
online casino with paysafecard 
best online casinos that accept paysafecard
paysafecard casino sites 


INDIVIDUAL FUNCTION NOTES:

get_keywords()
    takes an int argument to determine the number of keywords required
    starts a while loop asking the user for a KW input
    after each entry, it ticks down the int argument by -1 until it reaches 0
    bullshit to test, used pytest-mock  module to pass inputs during the loop
    returns a list of the keywords formatted as individual dictionaries (not sure if correct approach, might change this to normal list where each kw is a list entry. Maybe the parse() function can return a dictionary with the number of keyword matches)

word_document()
    this function uses the docx module to extract the text from the docx file
    a file is passed into the Document() function, which then recovers all paragraph elements and assigns them to a variable
    each item in the document variable represents a paragrah element in the docx format
    then the program loops over that data structure and appends every itteration to a list, while also formatting the itteration to standard readable text using i.text
    the function returns the new list containing every paragraph on a different list index, this includes white spaces, Word lists, etc. It does not include tables in any form

format()
    consider adding a separate function to format the text file
    the idea is to remove all punctuation symbols and html tags

parse()
    ***IMPORTANT***: parsing method doesn't allow for overlap between keywords. E.g. if you have 3 'best online casino' and 1 'online casino' in text, only 1 match for 'online casino' will be registered, despite that 'best online casino' shares some of the same words. 
    
    this can take two arguments, one the document variable, the other - the kw list
    it can return an updated kw list 
    the function can the parsing can be done possibly with nested loops
    this should be case insenstitive
    consider how to deal with html tags in text
